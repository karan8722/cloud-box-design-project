## 🌐 How to Access on Local Network (LAN)

You can access CloudBox from any other device (Laptop, Mobile, Tablet) connected to the **same Wi-Fi/Network**.

1.  **Find your Host IP Address:**
    * **Windows:** Open Command Prompt (`cmd`) and type `ipconfig`. Look for **IPv4 Address** (e.g., `192.168.1.10` or `10.110.0.106`).
    * **Mac/Linux:** Open Terminal and type `ifconfig` or `ip a`.

2.  **Access on Other Device:**
    Open the browser on the other device and type:
    `http://<YOUR_IP_ADDRESS>:5000`
    
    *Example:* `http://192.168.1.10:5000`

**Note:** If the site doesn't load on other devices, ensure your firewall is allowing traffic on port 5000. You may need to temporarily turn off the firewall or create an inbound rule.

To open permanently : open CMD and run this command 
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Flask 5000" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=5000
